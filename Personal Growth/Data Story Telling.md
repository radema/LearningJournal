Key components:
* Story
* Flow
* Structured Arguments

Blueprint:
1. Introduction & Context (1 Slide)
2. Conclusion
3. Pyramid Structure
4. Title Storyline & Slide Flow

Introduction & Context => SCQA framework (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)
Conclusion is the Answer in the SCQA framework

Pyramid:
* Back your conclusion with 3-5 arguments
* Support arguments with data
* 1 argument per slide
* No Overlaps or missings
* "Nice to Haves" go in the Appendix

Slide titles must summarize the argument but not be too wordy. Then create the slide so that it supports the title.
