# Learning Journal
#learning #mrrip #journal

### What is this
The goal of this repository is to contain all the learning materials I may find useful for personal projects and development.

The premise behind it to improve and change something I'm  not too aware or familiar. This learning journal can help me “slow-down”, evaluate and structure my knowledge at the pace I need.

### Why I am doing it

I'm pretty keen to master continuous learning. It is an essential skill which I learnt to love during my PhD in Mathematics. However, while during my phd period I was able to manage my learnings and setup a strategy efficiently without tools and planning, the number of things I want to master and the related complexity, due to my job as a consultant in Data Science, is much higher. 

For this reason, I decided to set up this repository to define a strategy and some tools to improve my continuous learning, build an efficient method and, mayber, provide usuful informations for the readers.

### Repository Structure

The repository will be structured in several folders. The main one contain the Daily Log were I will insert all sparse notes. 

The others will contain (I hope) structured notes related to specific subjects or topics. 
At the moment, I'm considering the following:
- **Continuous Learning**, to store all information and resources related to strategy to define and improve this skill
- **Data science, ML & Advance Analytics**, to build and track an organized knowledge about the technical stuff useful for my job
- **Project Glimpse and Ideas**, sparse notes on things I would like to work on or, at least, I would try to study
- **Project Management**, stuff useful to improve my skill related to project management, team leading, mentoring, coaching, etc.

New folders may appear in the future.
