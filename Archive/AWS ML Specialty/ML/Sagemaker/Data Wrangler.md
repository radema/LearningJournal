This tool allows users to import, prepare, transform, visualize, and analyze data with little to no coding. 
It also provides built-in and custom data transformations and analysis, including feature target leakage and quick modeling. 

Users can integrate Data Wrangler with [[SageMaker Processing]], [[SageMaker Pipelines]], and [[SageMaker Feature Store]] to simplify the task of processing, sharing, and storing ML training data. 

Additionally, Amazon [[SageMaker Clarify]] can be used to determine whether the data used to train models or the resulting model encodes any bias. It can also help explain models created with tabular, image, or NLP data with partial dependence plots, feature importance, and more.
