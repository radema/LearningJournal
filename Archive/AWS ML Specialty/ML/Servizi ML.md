| Service Name | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bedrock | Serverless service to create and scale generative AI applications using foundation models (FM). Bedrock also offers integrations with Amazon SageMaker's ML features, such as Experiments and Pipelines, to manage FMs at scale. | https://aws.amazon.com/it/bedrock/ |
| Sagemaker | [[SageMaker]] | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/ |
| SageMaker Canvas | Visual interface for business analysts to generate accurate ML predictions without requiring any ML experience or writing a single line of code. With SageMaker Canvas, users can access ready-to-use models or create custom models to extract information and generate predictions. The tool provides built-in exploratory data analysis with visualizations, automatic model creation, and built-in collaboration with data scientists. Users can also register ML models created in Amazon SageMaker Canvas to the SageMaker Model Registry with a single click so they can operationalize ML models to production | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/canvas/ |
| Data Labeling | [[Ground Truth]] | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/data-labeling/ |
| Data Wrangler | [[Data Wrangler]] | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/data-wrangler/ |
| Feature Store | [[SageMaker Feature Store]] | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/feature-store/ |
| Studio Lab | Similiar to Codelab | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/studio-lab/ |
| Studio | Jupyterlab like interface which allows to access the ML services | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/studio/ |
| Entity Resolution | Service that helps match, link, and enhance related records stored across multiple applications, channels, and data stores.Â It offers configurable entity matching workflows, including ready-to-use rule-based matching and preconfigured ML matching. | https://aws.amazon.com/it/entity-resolution/ |
| ML Governance | Amazon SageMaker provides tools to help implement machine learning (ML) responsibly, including SageMaker Role Manager, SageMaker Model Cards, and SageMaker Model Dashboard. These tools allow for the simplification of access control, documentation of models, and monitoring of model behavior. | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/ml-governance/ |
| Sagemaker Edge | ML service that allows users to deploy machine learning models on edge devices. It optimizes models trained in TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, XGBoost, and TensorFlow Lite so they can be deployed on any edge device. It also allows users to deploy models across a fleet of devices independent of firmware and application updates, and to continuously improve models with smart data capture for model retraining. SageMaker Edge Compiler automatically optimizes ML models for deployment on a wide variety of edge devices. SageMaker Edge Manager provides a dashboard so users can understand the performance of models running on each device across their fleet. The dashboard helps users visually understand overall fleet health and identify problematic models through a dashboard in the console. When a problem is identified, users can collect model data, relabel the data, retrain the model, and redeploy the model. Amazon SageMaker Edge has been used by companies such as Lenovo and Basler AG to remotely monitor, improve, and update the models on their edge devices around the world, saving them time and costs | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/edge/ |
| Sagemaker Clarify | Explainability service to detect bias in your model | https://aws.amazon.com/it/sagemaker/clarify/ |
