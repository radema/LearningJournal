#DataEngineering #storage #aws

### General

* Object storage of AWS -> support any kind of formats
* Max object size 5 TB
* It is the backbone of many ML services
* Create a #datalake 
	* infinite size, no privitioning
	* 11 9s durability for all classes
* Decoupled respect to computation resources

**Data Partitioning**
	* pattern for speeding up range queries
	* sometimes induced by other services ( for example [[AWS Glue]])
### Storage Classes
It depends on the availability
* Standard = General Purpose (Low latency, high availability, frequent access)
* Standard Infrequent Access (less available) -> use case: disaster recovery and backups
* One Zone Infrequente Access (high durability in a single zone, less availability) Use case: secondary backup of not primary data

Low cost object storage for backups. Pricing = storage + retrieval:
	* Glacier Instant Retrieval
	* Glacier Flexible Retrieval
	* Glacier Deep Archive

* Intelligent Tiering


Change class manually or by S3 Lifecycle configuration

### Security
* User Based
	* IAM Policies
* Resource Based
	* Bucket Policies
	* Access Control List
		* Object
