Small test to apply a clustering algorithm to extract a color palette. <- Done. 
A nice notebook on Codelaboratory:
- [Processo estrazione color palette.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a6SVLmEEjeG6Sug8VVgWeY91GvUIu8YY)


Few ideas:
- explore effect of different algorithm
- explore the effect of pixel position
- explore the possibility to not average colors but look for the "average" color between the ones in the exising image
