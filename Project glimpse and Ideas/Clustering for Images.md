Small test to apply a clustering algorithm to extract a color palette. <- Done. A nice notebook on Codelaboratory

Few ideas:
- explore effect of different algorithm
- explore the effect of pixel position
- explore the possibility to not average colors but look for the "average" color between the ones in the exising image
