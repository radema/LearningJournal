#CareerDevelopment 

### Ultimate goal 
to identify and take steps that will help you align your career with your deeper purpose and skills.
 
 **Write down your career traps** -> ''patterns of thinking and behaving that we practice because they are familiar to us — even though they can negatively impact our productivity and effectiveness and lead to poor health as well as feelings of isolation.'' ^5e64d2
 
 Common traps:
 1. Ambition trap
 2. Expectation trap
 3. Busyness trap
 4. Translation trap
 5. Adrenalin trap

**Define your purpose** -> Your purpose is your “why” —  the reason you do what you do. ^3e8a8c
> For some of us, it may be to lead a happy and healthy life. For others, it may be to create a life filled with learning and passing on those lessons. Purpose can center around study, experimentation, and trying new things. It can involve serving our communities, taking risks, or venturing into the unknown. Whatever our purpose, research shows that we can find meaning in our work by putting our why at the center of our decision-making.
> Once you know your purpose (which, by the way, can shift and change over time), you can be more intentional about dropping the habits that don’t serve you (your career traps) and doing things that bring you closer to it. When picking a job or career path or saying yes to a new project, for example, you can ask yourself, “Does this align with what really matters to me? Does it get me one step closer to living a life aligned with my purpose?”

**Document your unique skills and create your selling statement.** Take some time to identify unique skills or your Unique Selling Point (USP) -> try this exercise: ^90070f
-   Divide a sheet of paper into two columns (or use Google Sheets or a Word file).
-   List the skills and competencies you know you have in one column. Include role-specific technical and functional skills (i.e. programming, design, or accounting), as well as non-role-specific competencies (i.e. problem-solving, relationship building, or creativity).
-   For each item on your list, ask, “What value and benefit does this offer an employer?” and add your responses in the next column. For example, your digital skills may help an organization elevate its digital presence, or your strong relationship building techniques may support a business looking to improve its customer engagement.
-   Look at your experience and expertise and highlight your greatest strengths — the specific skills you do best and make you an especially valuable candidate.

Start drafting what I call your “selling statement,” or a short explanation of who you are, what you stand for, and the value you can bring to any team, culture, or organization. Play with the words and sentences until you find a combination that accurately captures your essence.

**Seize opportunities to expand yourself.** Need to be strategic and consider how the opportunity aligns with your purpose, goals, current skills, and the skills you need to build to get to where you want to go. ^97ecf6
