#booklist 

## Introduction

Book suggested at work. It derives from the traditional *Get the things done* (GTD). It aims to overcome some weaknesses of GTD.

**Why ZTD:**
- Focus on one habit at a time
- Focus on Doing
- Structured
- Simplified
- Focus on your goal

**What is:** set of 10 habit which help you organize and simplify your life, getting things under control and actually done. Not all 10 habits are obligation. Pick what is prefered. Each habit should be mastered one at a time if possible (30 days round). Suggested 1-8 as essential. 9-10 optional.

1. Collect -> capture notes for  (fundamental)
2. Process -> make quick decisions on things in your inbox at least once a day. (fundamental)
3. Plan -> list the more important tasks that you want to accomplish and schedule them first. List 3 things each day that you want to do (fundamental)
4. Do -> do one task at a time, without distractions. Don't try to multi-task (fundamental)
5. Simple Trusted System -> keep simple lists, check daily. 
6. Organize -> seems similar to Process.
7. Review -> review your system and goals weekly. 
8. Simplify -> reduce your goals & tasks to essentials
9. Routine -> set and keep routines.
10. Find your passion -> seek work for which you're passionate

Some change methodology:
1. Commitment
2. Practice <- The main one I think I'll adopt
3. Motivation
4. Tracking <- the other one
5. Support
6. Rewards
7. Focus for 30 days <- the last one
8. Positive thinking

## Collect
Have few amount of places to collect information and papers.
-> In my one, I already used a journal based on #obsidian and markdown files. 
Not everything can go in the journal. So we can adopt other destination. An inbox for everything. Not one for each kind of information source but one to collect all.
- Inbox -> collect incoming stuff from external sources
- Notebook/journal -> collect ideas and stuff from "internal" source

A digital notebook is not always available. In this case could be a good way to use emails as notes or analogical notes.

This habit is now essentially mastered.

## Process
Process to empty the inbox. Process inboxes at least once a day and more frequently if needed. 
1. Minimize the inboxes. The more the harder, so reduce the number. List all way you receive information, evaluate each to see if it gives you value, and find ways to combine or eliminate inboxes.
2. Don't allow the inboxes to overflow
3. Check and process the inboxes once a day or more if necessary. Don't check constantly and obsessively. 

How to check the inbox:
- Process from the top down, making quick and immediate decisions.
- Delete if you don't need it.
- Delegate if you do not have to do it.
- Do it immediately if it takes 2 minutes or less.
- Defer it for lates if it takes more than 2 minutes. Add it to your to-do list to do lates
- File it if it's something you need for reference.
In all cases, don't leave items in the inbox. Delete or file them.

## Plan

It's the key habit. How to do:
1. Choose a Big Rock. 
2. Get zoned. Eliminate all distractions.

5. If you feel the urge to check your email or switch to another task, stop yourself. Breathe deeply. Re-focus yourself. Get back to the task at hand.
6. The inevitable. some interruptions are too urgent. In that case, make a note of where you are and put all the documents or notes for that task together and aside.
7. Relax. Take breaks sometimes.
