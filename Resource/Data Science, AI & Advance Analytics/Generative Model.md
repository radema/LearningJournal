A **generative model** is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution $𝑃(𝑋,𝑌)$ on a given observable variable _X_ and target variable _Y_; hence, a generative model can be used to "generate" random instances of an observation _x_.

With the rise of deep learning, a new family of methods, called deep generative models (DGMs), is formed through the combination of generative models and deep neural networks.

**Examples**
* (Gaussian) [[General Mixture Models]]
* [[Hidden Markov Models]]
* [[Bayesian Network]]
* [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]]
* [[Boltzmann Machine]]
* [[Variational Autoencoder]]
* [[GANs]]
* [[Flow-based generative model]]
* [[Energy Based models]]
* [[Diffusion models]]
