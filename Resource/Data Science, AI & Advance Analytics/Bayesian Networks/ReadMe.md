This repository contains personal notes on Bayesian Network. 
Every folder and file focus on a specific topic. 

# Intro

A **[[Bayesian Network]]** is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (i.e. DAG). 

[[Causal networks]] are only a special cases of Bayesian networks. 
<!-- Why this difference? Are there bayesian networks which are not causal networks?-->

Bayesian networks can be used to describe sequences of variables, such as speech signals, transactions, logs, etc. These networks are called **dynamic bayesian networks**.
