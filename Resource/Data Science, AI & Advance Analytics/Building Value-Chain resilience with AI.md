In this article, three key factor of success are identified about implementing digital supply-chain tecnologies:
- value-driven solution design: Define which challenges each solution should address (*business tasks*) , who should be the primary user (*stakeholder*), and which process should benefit (*business metric*).
- enhanced business process and capability building: Redesign or enhance the business processes. Improve *data governance* to facilitate high-quality data for enabling these AI solutions. Bring in expected end users to codesign AI solutions while upskilling them with the required technological capabilities (*Agile approach*).
- seamless technological implementation: Begin by making the relevant data available. Ensure close collaboration among data scientists, operators, and stakeholders while building AI-enabled solutions. Develop user interfaces and user experiences (UI and UX) to support processes and integrate solutions into the organizational IT landscape.
