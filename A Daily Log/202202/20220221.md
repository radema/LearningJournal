article con [geometric distribution](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-for-data-scientists-the-great-geometric-distribution-586ce424c26b) -> it is a waiting time distribution.
- can be used in predictive maintenance to predict number of days for next issue? -> trovato questo articolo abbastanza interessante [Bayesian Feature Discovery for Predictive Maintenance](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03154496/document)


-> after some research found this other article on medium which seems promising: [ML for equipment failure prediction and predictive maintenance](https://medium.com/swlh/machine-learning-for-equipment-failure-prediction-and-predictive-maintenance-pm-e72b1ce42da1) interesting approach to be used for a project about wagon failure.
Some ideas:
- increas window size depending on median "failure" time (for technical incidents only!)
- try to build for each windowed features (min, max, median, mean) and change respect to the mean
