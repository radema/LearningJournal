## Data Lakes

![[Data Lake on AWS.png]]

* Unstructured object storage
* DL paradigm: data is loaded and then transformed at read-time *schema on demand* -> ELT
* Risk of high data complexity, bottlenecks in large organizations, poor BI e analytics performance

## Cloud-native Data Warehouse

![[DW on Azure.png]]

* long-standing architecture
* drawbacks: costs due to running and storing

## Data Lakehouse

* simple merge of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses. 
* populare choice for clients accelerating their advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities
	* modern analytics-optimised, efficient data formats capable of ACID transactions and other sophisticated features like data versioning, auto-partitioning and real-time stream optimizations
	* simplified, on-demand, elastic spark for general purpose compute via Python and/or SQL
	* Merging of DW and data science capabilities in a single place to reduce complexity
* good choice for Machine Learning projects (prioritization of raw data and computing)
* lack of vendor choice at the moment. Only Databricks -> Delta Lake open source offering
