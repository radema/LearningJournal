[article on negative emotions management in team](https://hbr.org/2022/02/managing-anger-frustration-and-resentment-on-your-team?utm_source=pocket_mylist)

* focus first on stabilizing your own emotions. Depersonalize how you receive both the direct and indirect feedback that your team is angry. Itâ€™s essential to perceive these inputs as data
* ask for more information, demonstrating that you care enough to acknowledge it to your team. And reframe the concept of anger at work, so you and your team can handle it with sensibility
* initiate methods to channel their frustration toward more constructive outcomes.
* Consider whether you have any blind spots in your leadership approach that may be contributing to their anger
