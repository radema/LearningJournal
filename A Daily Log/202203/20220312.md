### Notes

Few days ago find out the interesting news about the new bachelor degree course about #mathematics and #ml at Sapienza University

[link](https://www.mat.uniroma1.it/didattica/corsi-di-laurea/scienze-matematiche-intelligenza-artificiale-triennale?utm_source=pocket_mylist)

Interesting courses:
- *Matematica per il machine learning* by Dario Benedetto,
- *Etica dell’intelligenza artificiale* by Fabrizio Rufo,
- *Comunicazione scientifica* by Isabella Saggio
- *Architetture degli elaboratori per l’intelligenza artificiale* by Casalicchio

I don't expect any particular innovation or new information but still useful to retrieve some reference material and books.

**Learning strategy in a company**
#learning #CareerDevelopment  ^508b1c

Article written for "learners" in companies.

Different perspective respect to traditional learning (schools, courses, university) and much more similiar to the approach used by graduates. 
Formal programs are a partial of a development program or strategy, and not the main course.

Three risks when you depend on formal courses:
1. risk being disappointed if your request can’t be funded because other priorities take precedent
2. underestimate how costly it is for you to be away from work
3. focusing on formal development can reinforce a passive mindset and leave you with the false impression that your development is in someone else’s hands.

It is preferable an "on the job" strategy.
1. **decide on a skill you want to develop**
2. **do some research on the skill you’re trying to develop**
3. **set a series of progressive goals**
4. **ask a colleague for feedback to get a sense of how you’re doing**
