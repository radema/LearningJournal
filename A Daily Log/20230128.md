> continually invest in making your environment better. If you can move quickly and safely, you’ll spend less time on repetitive work and you’ll be able to do more. Increasing your velocity increases your reliability, too: every minute you shave off your time to detect a problem or deploy a fix is a minute you’ve taken off every outage.

>  Look for optimizations that will let you build, deploy, and release more quickly: smaller builds, intuitive tooling, fixing or deleting flaky tests, repeatable processes, automation everywhere. Be judicious about where you invest: building tooling, platforms, or processes take time, so choose the optimizations that will genuinely make a difference.

Suggestion given in the article: 
* Anticipate what you'd wish you'd done
	* be clear about the direction
	* remember the rule for good camping "leave stuff better when you found them"
	* keep your tools sharp -> continuous improvement
	* create institutional memory
* Expect failure
* Optimize for maintenance (hence production), not creation
