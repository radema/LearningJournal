# Introduction
In this note, all the material and ideas about learning strategies will be collected, also in relation to one's career. 
Learning is definitely a fundamental part of my life and my goal is to learn continuously to improve my skills. 

During my PhD. this was quite natural and, in a way, my job. However, after I started my job in consulting this became more and more difficult  as time was passing and projects and responsibilities were increasing. Moreover, I was further stressed by the partial gap between what I wanted to investigate and what was required in my daily work. 

After two burnouts, I understood how to manage this issue and that I was adopting the wrong strategy, i.e. no strategy.
Indeed, I realized I was still trying to learn voraciously as a PhD student with a lot of manageble time. Hence, after some research and reflections, I want to define (or may clarify) few aspects about my (meta-)learning:
1. Goals and Objectives
2. Strategy
3. Prioritization
4. Methods

This four aspects are obviosly related to each other and, onestly, it is not easy to distinguish them. In this note I want to setup a simple overview and manage it along time based on what I read.
