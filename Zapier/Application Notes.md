### In 3-5 sentences, tell us why you'd be a good fit for this role? 

I believe you are looking for someone who is able to provide valuable insights from data to tackle strategic decisions. I focus my projects, both professionally and personally, on using a data-driven approach to find the best option and strategy with respect to stakeholders' needs. I believe that my expetience as a research and as a consultant makes me the best match for this position. As a consultant I've been continuously involved in several projects where I had to bring business insights with data. With this opportunity, I would like to focus more my career and skills on this kind of problems.

### What's your preferred toolset for performing analyses and delivering results to stakeholders?

I choose the proper tools based on the task to be solved, time and effort. For a fast analysis I often use excel and python, but I usually would prefer to work with jupyter, python and SQL. These allow me to start immediately to manage data quality and build pipeline to automatically standardize data, define the most important KPIs end eventually experiment with machine learning models. 

Lastly, I often use a dashboarding/reporting tool like Google Data Studio, PowerBI to have a graphic representation of the insights for data from structured sources or python libraries (like plotly, seaborn or pyplot). The choice depends on the overall stack and what I need to accomplish. I often prefer to choose the tools which allow me to provide an automated and reproducible solution.


### Tell us about a piece of quantitative or experimental analysis you're proud to have delivered that helped to move the business forward. What initiated the work? How did you deliver it to stakeholders?

A relevant business stakeholder, responsible in our customer's CERT for the email fraud detection system, was complaining for the high rate of false positive in its system. 
He asked for an explainable solution able to reduce the false positive rate (FPR). 
I started an analysis using HQL and Excel to understand the data source he was using, the adopted KPIs, percentage of detected cases and specific analysis on few cases that the user detected as false positive.
I found out that the system was not considering rolling KPIs based on end-users recent history; then, I developed an unsupervised algorithm using HQL and RapidMiner and a classificator to integrate the stakeholder dashboard. As a result, the FPR reduced and the stakeholder was able to identify more significant cases. 

### Describe a time when you detected a problem in a data processing pipeline and the steps you took to determine where the problem was.

Once, I took over a new project from a colleague who has changed jobs. The business user reported high missing data as a result of the processing pipeline. I analysed the daily percentage of missing values for the attribute specified by the user. 

I found out that the percentage was in average the 45% and started from a specific date. I analyzed the pipeline, built by my previous colleague with SQL and stored procedures, and I found out that, after carrying out data recovery activities, he forgot to restore an element of the pipeline.

Once I restored the element, the percentage of missing values reduced to 0%. 

### What are you really good at professionally? What are you seeking to improve at? What are you not interested in doing regularly?

I think to be a good resource investigator and coordinator in projects I'm involved with. Indeed, I pay close attention to the choice of tools, to the strategy and the development of the most suitable solution for a task. In the next future, I want to improve and specialize my skills as a scientist and deepen my knowledge on project management. Lastly, I'm not interested repetitive maintanance tasks, especially if they can be automated.

### Optional: Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?
  
I am very interested in finding a reality where it is possible to collaborate within a team, work on measurable tasks and explore new solutions. I believe that improvement and progressive learning over time are very important. In fact, I invest part of my free time in carrying out personal projects to solve tasks and learn new things. 
For example, since I have a passion for personal finance stuff, I am currently developing a series of data pipelines to generate dashboards about my investments.
